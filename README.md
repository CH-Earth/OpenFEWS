# Can Open FEWS

Open and shareable configuration for an operational hydrological forecasting system with Delft-FEWS. A complete system configuration is provided for data access, processing, visualization and application in modelling. The technical focus is on rain and snow for operational forecasting, and applied in a mountainous environment.

This repository has been made to spur community development, so please feel free to use the configuration in your own applications. Also make contributions back! Whether new data, models, methods or displays are all welcome.
